# my portfolio
My portfolio website in development. 
Trying out the combination of video editing and css, which i used for the different sections. can be done with only css too, but this saved me a lot of time and has some cool effects in it, which cannot be achieved with css alone ( for example glitch effect, vhs effects etc. ) Please let me know if you see anything that could be better, or if you have any tips and advice, i love to hear from you! will be updating the portfolio soon, to show some templates with video effects.
